The data contains sequences recorded in two different settings:
- LAB 'epfl-lab.tar.gz'
- CORRIDOR 'epfl-corridor.tar.gz'

For an example of how to obtain the curves similar to the ones in the paper see 'evaluation-sample.tar.gz'

IMPORTANT: The simplest way to use the ground truth is to load it from pickle files from 'updated-ground-truth.tar.gz'
